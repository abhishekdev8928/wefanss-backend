<h2>The Story of Bhishma Pitamah: A Life of Sacrifice and Duty— Understanding Life Choices with Career Astrology Consultation
</h2>


<p>Bhishma Pitamah was originally known by the name Devavrata. His parents were King Shantanu of Hastinapura and the river goddess Ganga. The Hindu texts mention that he was an extraordinary warrior, scholar, and statesman. 

</p>

<p>However, his life took a pivotal turn when he took the vow of celibacy to ensure his father's marriage to Satyavati. He renounced his claim to the throne of Hastinapura.
</p>
<p>
This sacrifice earned him the name Bhishma. The word means “the one who undertakes a severe vow.” His father blessed him with the boon of choosing the moment of his death (Ichcha Mrityu).
</p>

<p>During the Mahabharata war, Bhishma fought valiantly on the side of the Kauravas (despite his personal affection for the Pandavas). He was invincible in battle and resisted the Pandavas' advances for ten days. 

</p>

<p>Ultimately, he was felled by Arjuna, assisted by Shikhandi, during the war. Bhishma lay on a bed of arrows for over fifty days. During that time, he offered counsel to the Pandavas on Shanti Parva and Anushasana Parva. He imparted invaluable wisdom on dharma, governance, and the nature of life and death to them.
</p>

<p>As the day of his death approached, Bhishma chose the auspicious ‘Magha Shukla Ashtami’ for his departure. Uttarayan  is the period  when the Sun begins its northward journey. It is a time believed to be spiritually favourable for attaining moksha. This decision, marking his final act of supreme devotion and sacrifice, is the essence of “Bhishma Ashtami.”
</p>
<p>Liberation and conscious choice remind us that every soul follows a unique karmic path shaped by time and intention. Understanding this journey requires awareness of one’s inner patterns, duties, and turning points in life.
</p>
<p>A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ekohumm.com/service/astronumero-vedic-consulting">chart reading</a>  offers insight into these deeper influences, helping individuals recognise their life purpose, karmic lessons, and spiritual timing with clarity and balance.</p>


<h2>Rituals and Observances on “Bhishma Ashtami”</h2>

<p>On “Bhishma Ashtami”, devotees perform several holy rituals to pay reverence to Bhishma Pitamah. Performing fasting and offering prayers on this day offers many spiritual benefits. People also perform a special rite known as ‘Tarpan’ as well. It is a ritual to appease one's ancestors.
</p>

<p>Let's learn more about these rituals in detail below. 
</p>


<h3>1. Ekodishta Shradh (Shradh for Bhishma)
</h3>

<p>‘Ekodishta Shradh’ is one of the most important rituals of “Bhishma Ashtami” to honour Bhishma Pitamah. If you have lost your father, performing this rite is very important for you. 
</p>

<p>***Important: While Vedic texts mention that ‘Ekodishta Shradh’ is to be performed by people with deceased fathers, many communities choose to perform it regardless of their father’s status. They believe that it brings blessings for the entire family.
</p>


<h3>2. Tarpan and Offering Prayers at River Banks
</h3>

<p>‘Tarpan’ is also a significant part of “Bhishma Ashtami” rituals. To perform this, the devotees offer water, sesame seeds, and other sacred items in a river. Typically, people choose to perform it in the Ganga River (Mother- Mata of Bhishma Pitamah). 
</p>

<p>‘Tarpan’ honours Bhishma Pitamah and one's ancestors. It brings peace to the souls of the departed and purifies the performer. People make the offering with the hope that the blessings of Bhishma Pitamah will lead to spiritual liberation and remove any obstacles from their lives.
</p>

<h3>3. Fasting and Ritual Observances
</h3>

<p>Many devotees also observe a fast on “Bhishma Ashtami.” They abstain from food and water for the day. The holy texts mention that the fast purifies the body and mind. It also fosters a connection to Bhishma’s spirit of sacrifice and devotion. 

</p>

<p>During the fast, people offer Arghyam. It is a sacred offering of water. They also chant the Bhishma Ashtami mantra "Evasunamavataraya Shantoratmajay Ch.” It imparts Bhishma’s blessings for righteousness and wisdom.
</p>

<h3>4. Taking a Holy Dip in the Ganges
</h3>

<p>When people come to the shores of the Ganga River to perform Tarpan on “Bhishma Ashtami”, they also take a dip in the sacred waters. This observance has purifying powers. It washes away all the sins and provides spiritual merits. By doing so, devotees also align themselves with the purity and sanctity that Bhishma himself embodied throughout his life.

<h3>Spiritual Significance: Lessons from Bhishma Pitamah
</h3>


<p>The life of Bhishma Pitamah is a powerful lesson in devotion, sacrifice, and dharma. He is an ideal persona of righteousness for many due to his unwavering loyalty to his father. He has performed many selfless acts for the greater good. </p>
<p>As he chose to depart on the auspicious day of Uttarayana, it signifies the triumph of virtue and the fulfilment of one’s duties. 

</p>

<p>Let's learn more about Bhishma Pitamah’s teachings that continue to resonate in spiritual practice.
</p>


<h3>Dharma (Righteous Duty): 
</h3>

<p>Bhishma’s life exemplifies the importance of dharma. He always placed his duties to the kingdom. And, his family was always above his personal desires.</p>


<h3>Sacrifice for the Greater Good:</h3>

<p>During his whole life, Bhishma has made sacrifices for the greater good. One of the most significant examples is when he took the vow of celibacy. He refused to claim the throne of Hastinapur for the happiness of his father and the well-being of the kingdom. 
</p>

<h3>Wisdom in Adversity: 
</h3>

<p>During the fierce battle of the Mahabharata, when he was in immense pain, he did not lose his composure. We should admire and emulate his qualities of calmness and wisdom in times of hardship. 
</p>


<h3>Forgiveness and Letting Go of Anger: 
</h3>


<p>Bhishma taught that we can achieve peace through forgiveness and letting go of anger. When we hold grudges, it only leads to negativity and discord.
</p>

<p>In relationships, too, especially between partners in marriage or committed bonds, holding onto anger and unresolved emotions can slowly create distance and misunderstanding. Just as Bhishma Pitamah taught forgiveness and restraint, harmony in relationships grows when we understand emotional patterns and respond with awareness rather than reaction.

</p>


<h3>Detachment from Material Possessions: </h3>

<p>We can learn from Bhishma’s life that we shouldn't become overly attached to worldly possessions and relationships. They are all transient.
</p>

<h2>The Spiritual Perspective of “Bhishma Ashtami”
</h2>

<p>“Bhishma Ashtami” is a true reminder of the timeless fact that ‘soul is eternal.’ It also signifies the importance of detachment from material life. 
</p>


<p>When Bhishma Pitamah consciously chose to die at an auspicious time, it represents the soul’s freedom from the cycle of birth and death. 
</p>

<p>On this auspicious occasion, reflect on your life and reaffirm your commitment to righteous living. Let go of attachments that bind the soul to the physical world.</p>

<p>Additionally, the fasts and rituals people perform on “Bhishma Ashtami” are symbolic of one's desire to purify the self. They signify the importance of overcoming past karmic debts and progress towards spiritual liberation. 
</p>



<p>Consider “Bhishma Ashtami” as a sacred opportunity to align yourself with the virtues of Bhishma. And, seek his divine blessings for wisdom, long life, and peace.
</p>

<p>The sacred Vedas mention that “Bhishma Ashtami” is a prominent day for couples suffering from ‘putra dosha.’ If you are a childless couple or a newlywed, observe a strict fast on this day. It will offer the blessings of Bhishma Pitamah and grant a son with his admirable qualities.

<h2>Testimony:
</h2>

<p>When I met Ekktaa about five months ago, I was going through a difficult phase in my life. I was under financial stress, lacked support from my family members, and had started losing confidence. Money that I had lent to friends was stuck, and although my business was running, I felt unsure about its growth and the right time to move ahead. I wanted to invest in social media promotions, however I was in a dilemma if it was the right time, as I was fearful of losing money.
</p>

<p>
After a detailed birth chart reading, Ekktaa gave me clear and practical guidance. She advised that after June 2025, it would be a favourable time to actively begin social media promotion and also things will start falling in place. Trusting her insights, I took the step—and soon started noticing a positive shift in my confidence, clarity, and overall professional momentum.
</p>

<p>What truly amazed me was how accurately the financial timelines matched. From the first week of December, I began receiving the money that I had lent. Today, I feel more focused, empowered, and grateful, and I have confidently referred several people to Ekktaa for her guidance.
